## Question #: 01
### Topic #: 2 - Design High-Performing Architectures

**Question:**  
A company is designing the network for an online multi-player game. The game uses the UDP networking protocol and will be deployed in eight AWS Regions. The network architecture needs to minimize latency and packet loss to give end users a high-quality gaming experience.

**What solution will meet these requirements?**

**A.** Set up a transit gateway in each Region. Create inter-Region peering attachments between each transit gateway.  
**B.** Set up AWS Global Accelerator with UDP listeners and endpoint groups in each Region.  
**C.** Set up Amazon CloudFront with UDP turned on. Configure an origin in each Region.  
**D.** Set up a VPC peering mesh between each Region. Turn on UDP for each VPC.

---

### âœ… Correct Answer: **B. Set up AWS Global Accelerator with UDP listeners and endpoint groups in each Region.**

---

### ðŸ“˜ Explanation:

AWS **Global Accelerator** is specifically designed for applications that require **low latency**, **minimal packet loss**, and **high availability** â€” exactly what online multiplayer games demand. It uses the **AWS global network infrastructure**, allowing user requests to enter the AWS backbone at the nearest edge location and travel over the optimized network path.

#### Benefits of Global Accelerator:
- Supports **UDP** traffic (critical for real-time gaming).
- Automatically routes traffic to the **nearest healthy endpoint** in the designated Region.
- Provides **regional failover**, improving fault tolerance.
- Minimizes **internet hops**, improving performance compared to standard public internet routing.

## Question #: 02
### Topic #: 2 - Design High-Performing Architectures

**Question:**  
A company hosts a serverless application on AWS. The application uses Amazon API Gateway, AWS Lambda, and an Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL database. The company notices an increase in application errors that result from database connection timeouts during times of peak traffic or unpredictable traffic. The company needs a solution that reduces the application failures with the least amount of change to the code.

**What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements?**

**A.** Reduce the Lambda concurrency rate.  
**B.** Enable RDS Proxy on the RDS DB instance.  
**C.** Resize the RDS DB instance class to accept more connections.  
**D.** Migrate the database to Amazon DynamoDB with on-demand scaling.

---

### âœ… Correct Answer: **B. Enable RDS Proxy on the RDS DB instance.**

---

### ðŸ“˜ Explanation:

When using AWS Lambda with Amazon RDS, a common challenge is **managing database connections**, especially during **traffic spikes**. Each Lambda invocation can potentially open a new database connection, quickly exhausting the connection pool of the RDS instance.

#### âœ… Why RDS Proxy is the best choice:
- **Manages and pools connections** efficiently.
- Helps avoid **connection exhaustion** during high concurrency.
- Requires **minimal code changes** (in most cases, just updating connection settings).
- **Improves database scalability and resilience** for serverless apps.

#### ðŸš« Why not the others?
- **A. Reduce Lambda concurrency rate** â€“ Might limit scalability and won't solve the root problem.
- **C. Resize RDS instance** â€“ Helps temporarily but doesn't solve connection storming from Lambda.
- **D. Migrate to DynamoDB** â€“ A large change in architecture; not minimal or quick.

## Question #: 03
### Topic #: 2 - Design High-Performing Architectures

**Question:**  
A company has a Java application that uses Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) to parse messages. The application cannot parse messages that are larger than 256 KB in size. The company wants to implement a solution to give the application the ability to parse messages as large as 50 MB.

**Which solution will meet these requirements with the FEWEST changes to the code?**

**A.** Use the Amazon SQS Extended Client Library for Java to host messages that are larger than 256 KB in Amazon S3.  
**B.** Use Amazon EventBridge to post large messages from the application instead of Amazon SQS.  
**C.** Change the limit in Amazon SQS to handle messages that are larger than 256 KB.  
**D.** Store messages that are larger than 256 KB in Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS). Configure Amazon SQS to reference this location in the messages.

---

### âœ… Correct Answer: **A. Use the Amazon SQS Extended Client Library for Java to host messages that are larger than 256 KB in Amazon S3.**

---

### ðŸ“˜ Explanation:

Amazon SQS has a **hard limit of 256 KB** for message size. If your application needs to send **larger messages (up to 2 GB)**, you must store the message payload **externally** and send a reference to it via SQS.

#### âœ… Why Option A is Correct:
- AWS provides the **Amazon SQS Extended Client Library for Java**, which seamlessly stores large message payloads in **Amazon S3**, and sends a pointer (reference) through SQS.
- This **minimizes code changes** and integrates smoothly into existing SQS-based Java applications.
- Allows messages up to **2 GB** in size (well above the 50 MB needed).

#### ðŸš« Why not the others?
- **B. EventBridge** is not designed for large message payloads (limit is 256 KB as well).
- **C.** You **cannot change the 256 KB limit** on SQS â€” itâ€™s a hard service limit.
- **D.** Amazon SQS cannot directly reference Amazon EFS files in its message body â€” this would require **custom logic** and **significant code changes**.
